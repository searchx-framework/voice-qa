        "query": "What is the role of T-tubules?",
        "answer": [ "The function of T-tubules is to conduct impulses from the surface of the cell (SARCOLEMMA) down into the cell and, specifically, to another structure in the cell called the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. T-tubules (transverse tubules) are extensions of the cell membrane that penetrate into the centre of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Through these mechanisms, T-tubules allow heart muscle cells to contract more forcefully by synchronising calcium release throughout the cell. Similarly, do T-tubules have voltage gated channels? Action potentials are conducted into the interior of muscle fibers via the T-tubules and there activate voltage-gated channels known as dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR). Muscle contraction relies on the movement of electrical charge through the T-tubules to trigger the release of calcium ions. Without the T-tubules, muscle contraction would not be possible.",
        "A myocyte is a long cylindrical cell with multiple nuclei located just below the sarcolemma, which is the cell membrane. The sarcolemma is unique because it makes these tiny tunnels called T-tubules that project downwards from the surface towards the center of the muscle fiber. The cytoplasm of a myocyte is called sarcoplasm, and the myocyte has a special type of smooth endoplasmic reticulum which is called sarcoplasmic reticulum. The sarcoplasmic reticulum stores lots of calcium and runs parallel to the T-tubules. Now, the sarcoplasm is filled with stacks of long filaments called myofibrils and each myofibril consists of contractile proteins and regulatory proteins. Contractile proteins include thick myosin and thin actin filaments. The thick myosin filament is made up of hundreds of myosin proteins, and each myosin protein has a tail and two myosin heads.",
        "Microtubules are hollow, fibrous shafts whose main function is to help support and give shape to the cell. They also serve a transportation function, as they are the routes upon which organelles move through the cell. They are most often found in all eukaryotic cells and, together with the microfilaments and intermediate filaments, form the cytoskeleton. Microtubules have many more jobs than just giving support to the cell. The microtubules also play a very important role during cell division. Their primary cell division function is to connect to the chromosomes, help those chromosomes complete their first split, and then move the new chromosomes to their places in the new daughter cells. This job is carried out by microtubules that make up the centrioles, organelles that have been given the specific job of helping cells divide."],

        "query": "Where does the welsh language originate from?",
        "answer": [ "The Celtic languages are a language family inside of Indo-European languages. There are six Celtic languages still spoken in the world today, spoken in north-west Europe. They are divided into two groups, Goidelic (or Gaelic) and the Brythonic (or British). The three Goidelic languages still spoken are Irish, Scottish, and Manx. Scottish is the main language spoken in parts of north-west Scotland and Irish is the main language spoken in the Gaeltacht in Ireland. Manx is spoken mainly by people interested in the language. The three Brythonic languages are Welsh, Cornish, and Breton. Of these Cornish became extinct in the 18th century but people have started speaking it again now. Welsh is spoken everywhere throughout Wales, but is mainly first language for people in the western part of Wales, in the area some people call the Bro Gymraeg.",
        "Is Welsh a difficult language? No, but it&#8217;s a very different language to English. Most English speakers who try to master a second language usually pick or are taught one which has something in common with their own, such as German, or French. Welsh has grown on a completely different branch of the language family tree, closely related to Cornish, Breton, Irish, and Scottish Gaelic. The different consonants and mutations in the Welsh language can seem completely alien to the English ear. This has given rise to the idea that it is an unreasonably difficult language to master &#8211; which is also a convenient excuse for those who can&#8217;t be bothered doing so! Welsh is as easy and as difficult to learn as any other language. And as with any other language, the best way to go about it is just to throw yourself in the deep end.",
        "English originated in England and remains its official language to this day. In fact, English is now the official language of many of the countries all over the world. Originally, Old English was spoken. This language had its origins in Indo-Europe and the Anglo-Frisian branch of a Germanic language, the people of which brought it to England in the fifth century of our Common Era (CE). However, when the Normans conquered England in the 11th century, Old English was reserved or the lower classes, while the upper classes spoke in Latin (the accepted language of the European Christian churches) and Norman French. Then, by the 1600&#8217;s, English had returned as the main language spoken by most of the country&#8217;s inhabitants. However, this was not the English of old. Rather, this more modern English, also called Middle English, had a distinctly French influence."],
