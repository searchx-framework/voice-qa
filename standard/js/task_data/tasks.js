        "Ethnographic research is a qualitative method where researchers observe and/or interact with a study&#x2019;s participants in their real-life environment. Ethnography was popularised by anthropology, but is used across a wide range of social sciences. Within the field of usability, user-centred design and service design, ethnography is used to support a designer&#x2019;s deeper understanding of the design problem, including the relevant domain, audience(s), processes, goals and context(s) of use."],

        "answer": [ "Introns and exons are parts of genes. Exons code for proteins, whereas introns do not. Exons are parts of DNA that are converted into mature messenger RNA . The process by which DNA is used as a template to create mRNA is called transcription. This mRNA then undergoes a further process called translation where the mRNA is used to synthesize proteins, via another type of molecule called transfer RNA.",
        "The coding region in mRNA is bounded by the five prime untranslated region and the three prime untranslated region, which are also parts of the exons. The CDS is that portion of an mRNA transcript that is translated by a ribosome. The coding region of an organism is the sum total of the organism&#x2019;s genome that is composed of gene coding regions.",
        "The major function of DNA is to encode the sequence of amino acid residues in proteins, using the genetic code. To read the genetic code, cells make a copy of a stretch of DNA in the nucleic acid RNA. These RNA copies can then used to direct protein synthesis, but they can also be used directly as parts of ribosomes or spliceosomes."],
